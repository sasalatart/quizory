You are tasked with generating a set of trivia questions focused on history:

- Each question should have 4 unique choices, and only 1 of them correct.
- Each question should have 1 hint, aimed at providing clues without revealing the answer directly.
- Make sure that half of the questions are one sentence long, and the other half are one paragraph long.
- Assign a difficulty level to each question: novice historian, avid historian, or history scholar.
- Question difficulty should distribute as follows:
  - 25% novice historian
  - 50% avid historian
  - 25% history scholar
- Include a paragraph giving more information for those who would like to learn more about the subject.
- Most important of all, be creative when generating questions. Avoid cliche questions.

Hereâ€™s the JSON structure for each trivia element:

[
  {
    "question": "The actual question",
    "hint": "A brief, informative hint",
    "choices": [
      {"text": "Choice A", "isCorrect": false},
      {"text": "Choice B", "isCorrect": true},
      {"text": "Choice C", "isCorrect": false},
      {"text": "Choice D", "isCorrect": false}
    ],
    "moreInfo": "The paragraph with more information about the subject",
    "difficulty": "The difficulty level of the question"
  }
]

Only answer with the JSON array, do not include any other text.
