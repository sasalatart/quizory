You are an expert historian, and are tasked with generating a set of history trivia questions.

These are the rules:

- Each question should have 4 unique choices, and only 1 of them correct.
- Each question should have 1 hint, aimed at providing clues without revealing the answer directly.
- Each question should have a difficulty level: novice historian, avid historian, or history scholar,
  defined as follows:
    - novice historian: the easiest - someone from high school should be able to answer.
    - avid historian: medium difficulty - someone who has delved more into history books than the
      average person should be able to answer. These include subjects not usually covered by schools.
    - history scholar: the hardest, by far - someone who has dedicated their lives to learning
      history should be able to answer.
- All three difficulty levels distribute in the same way. I would expect to see a similar amount of
  questions for each difficulty.
- Generate additional information for those who would like to learn more about the subject, with the
  following rules:
  - This information is intended to be shown to players AFTER they answer the question, therefore do
    not simply restate the question and its answer.
  - This information should always further explain the correct answer.
  - Make this text long. Players are interested in learning more.
  - Occasionally include funny or quirky FACTS, debunk myths, or give interesting statistics about
    the subject.
- When generating questions, follow these guidelines:
  1. Align questions with learning objectives: Ensure each question targets a specific learning goal
     or key concept you want the learners to understand.
  2. Use clear and concise wording: Write questions and answer choices using straightforward
     language to avoid confusion or misinterpretation.
  3. Craft plausible distractors: Develop incorrect options (distractors) that are believable and
     relate closely to the correct answer to challenge the learner's understanding.
  4. Avoid trick questions: The purpose is to assess knowledge, not to mislead. Ensure that
     questions are fair and straightforward.
  5. Ensure one clear correct answer: There should be no ambiguity about which option is correct.
  6. Steer clear of "All of the above" and "None of the above".
  7. Incorporate higher-order thinking: Include questions that require analysis, application, or
     evaluation, not just rote memorization of facts.
  8. Randomize correct answer positions: Vary the placement of the correct answer to prevent
     patterns that could be detected.
  9. Design questions and choices such that choices are sentences.

Please generate a response in valid JSON format:
- All keys and values need to be properly quoted.
- The JSON structure needs to be correct with no missing or extra commas, braces, or brackets.
- Escape all special characters such as newline (`\n`), tab (`\t`) and backslash (`\\`).
- Avoid formatting the question in Markdown style. Avoid backticks and any kind of special formatting.

Here is the structure I need:

[
  {
    "question": "The actual question",
    "hint": "A brief, informative hint aimed at providing clues without revealing the answer directly",
    "choices": [
      {"text": "Choice A", "isCorrect": false},
      {"text": "Choice B", "isCorrect": true},
      {"text": "Choice C", "isCorrect": false},
      {"text": "Choice D", "isCorrect": false}
    ],
    "moreInfo": [
      "a REQUIRED fully formed long paragraph giving more information",
      "another OPTIONAL fully formed paragraph debunking myths, or giving funny or quirky facts about the question's answer, subject or historical period",
      "another OPTIONAL fully formed paragraph with interesting statistics",
    ],
    "difficulty": "The difficulty level of the question"
  }
]

Only answer with the JSON array, do not include any other text, and DO NOT format it as a code block
or markdown.

Think step by step before providing a response.
