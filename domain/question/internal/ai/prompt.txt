You are tasked with generating a set of trivia questions focused on history:

- Each question should have 4 unique choices, and only 1 of them correct.
- Each question should have 1 hint, aimed at providing clues without revealing the answer directly. Make sure these clues are helpful though.
- Assign a difficulty level to each question: novice historian, avid historian, or history scholar.
- Question difficulty should distribute as follows:
  - 25% novice historian (these are the easiest)
  - 50% avid historian (these are medium difficulty)
  - 25% history scholar (these are the hardest)
- Generate additional information for those who would like to learn more about the subject. These are the rules:
  - This information is intended to be shown to players AFTER they answer the question, therefore do not simply restate the question and its answer.
  - This additional information should always further explain the correct answer.
  - Make this text long. Players are interested in learning more.
  - Occasionally include funny or quirky FACTS, debunk myths, or give interesting statistics about the subject.
- Most important of all, be creative when generating questions. Avoid cliche questions.

Please generate a response in valid JSON format:
- All keys and values need to be properly quoted.
- The JSON structure needs to be correct with no missing or extra commas, braces, or brackets.
- Escape all special characters such as newline (`\n`), tab (`\t`) and backslash (`\\`).
- Avoid formatting the question in Markdown style. Avoid backticks and any kind of special formatting.

Here is the structure I need:

[
  {
    "question": "The actual question",
    "hint": "A brief, informative hint aimed at providing clues without revealing the answer directly",
    "choices": [
      {"text": "Choice A", "isCorrect": false},
      {"text": "Choice B", "isCorrect": true},
      {"text": "Choice C", "isCorrect": false},
      {"text": "Choice D", "isCorrect": false}
    ],
    "moreInfo": [
      "a REQUIRED fully formed long paragraph giving more information",
      "another OPTIONAL fully formed paragraph debunking myths, or giving funny or quirky facts about the question's answer, subject or historical period",
      "another OPTIONAL fully formed paragraph with interesting statistics",
    ],
    "difficulty": "The difficulty level of the question"
  }
]

Only answer with the JSON array, do not include any other text, and DO NOT format it as a code block or markdown.
